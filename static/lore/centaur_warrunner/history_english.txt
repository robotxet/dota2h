To outsiders, the four-legged clans of Druud are often mistaken for simple, brutish creatures.  Their language has no written form; their culture lacks pictographic traditions, structured music, formalized religion.  For centaurs, combat is the perfect articulation of thought, the highest expression of self.  If killing is an art among centaurs, then Bradwarden the Warrunner is their greatest artist.  He rose to dominance on the proving grounds of Omexe, an ancient arena where centaur clans have for millennia gathered to perform their gladiatorial rites.  As his fame spread, spectators came from far and wide to see the great centaur in action.  Always the first to step into the arena, and the last to leave, he composes a masterpiece in each guttering spray, each thrust of blood-slickened blade-length.  It is the poetry of blood on steel, flung in complex patterns across the pale sands of the killing floor.
